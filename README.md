Hola! - application for online messaging

The project was written in Swift language (UIKit) using Firebase

We used Firebase for:

• Authorization via email

• Customize profile

• Realtime messanging 

Here you can see some user profile, if you click on your avatar 3 times it will change you avatar to random picture from https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/micah/ and save it to db

Dialog example:

In this project i used 3 pods:

• Firebase as backend

• SVProgressHUD to notify the user about the status of the request

• ReverseExtension for the correct display of the table view in the dialog


Good luck!
